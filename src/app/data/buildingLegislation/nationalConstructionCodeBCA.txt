Preface
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 9
About the NCC
The NCC is Australia’s primary set of technical design and construction provisions for buildings. As a performance-based
code, it sets the minimum required level for the safety, health, amenity, accessibility and sustainability of certain buildings.
It primarily applies to the design and construction of new buildings, and plumbing and drainage systems in new and existing
buildings. In some cases it may also apply to structures associated with buildings and new building work or new plumbing
and drainage work in existing buildings.
The Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB), on behalf of the Australian Government and each State and Territory
government, produces and maintains the NCC. When determining the content of the NCC, the ABCB seeks to—
• ensure requirements have a rigorously tested rationale; and
• effectively and proportionally address applicable issues; and
• create benefits to society that outweigh costs; and
• consider non-regulatory alternatives; and
• consider the competitive effects of regulation; and
• not be unnecessarily restrictive.
The primary users of the NCC include architects, builders, plumbers, building surveyors, hydraulic consultants, engineers
and other building and plumbing related professions and trades.
Format of the NCC
The NCC is published in three volumes. The Building Code of Australia (BCA) is Volumes One and Two of the NCC and
the Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA) is Volume Three of the NCC.
Components of the NCC
The NCC provides the technical provisions for the design and construction of buildings and other structures, and plumbing
and drainage systems.
NCC Volume One primarily covers the design and construction of multi-residential, commercial, industrial and public
assembly buildings and some associated structures.
NCC Volume Two primarily covers the design and construction of smaller scale buildings including houses, small sheds,
carports and some associated structures.
NCC Volume Three covers the design, construction and maintenance of plumbing and drainage systems in new and
existing buildings.
Each volume contains—
• Governing Requirements; and
• Performance Requirements; and
• compliance options to meet the NCC requirements; and
• State and Territory variations and additions.
The NCC uses building classifications to identify requirements for different intended purposes of buildings or parts of
buildings. A building classification relates to the characteristics and the intended use of the building. Information on building
classifications is found in Part A6 of the Governing Requirements.
Legislative arrangements and the NCC
The NCC is given legal effect through State and Territory, or other statutory authority, building and plumbing legislation.
These Acts and Regulations set out the legal framework and administration mechanisms for the NCC to support the design
and construction of buildings.
Introduction to the National Construction Code (NCC)
 (1 May 2023)
Preface
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 10
The dates of adoption of the NCC are determined by State and Territory building and plumbing administrations.
How to use the NCC
Each volume of the NCC is split into two main sections:
• Administrative requirements contained within the Governing Requirements.
• Technical requirements contained within the remaining sections of the NCC.
The Governing Requirements provide the rules and instructions for using and complying with the NCC. They are vital in
understanding how the technical requirements of the NCC should be applied to any particular situation. The Governing
Requirements are also important in understanding how the NCC fits with the building and plumbing regulatory framework
within Australia.
NCC clause numbering system
The NCC uses a uniform clause numbering system across each of its three volumes. This system is called Section-PartType-Clause (SPTC). In each clause number—
• The first letter indicates which NCC Section sits within, or if the letter S is used, that the clause is part of a Specification.
The letter S is used in place of a Section indicator because the same Specification may be called up in several different
Sections of the NCC.
• The first number indicates the number of each Part within a Section, or the number of a Specification. Parts are
numbered sequentially within each Section, starting at 1. Specifications are numbered sequentially across all three
volumes, also starting at 1.
• The second letter indicates the clause Type. It will be G, O, F, P, V, D or C and these are explained below.
• The second number is the clause number within each Part or Specification.
The clause Types used in the NCC are as follows:
• G = Governing requirement (mandatory)
• O = Objective (guidance)
• F = Functional Statement (guidance)
• P = Performance Requirement (mandatory)
• V = Verification Method (optional)
• D = Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision (optional)
• C = Clause in a Specification (clauses in Specifications may be mandatory or optional, depending on how the
Specification is called up by the NCC).
Informative parts of the NCC (e.g. Introduction to the NCC) are not numbered and do not have numbered paragraphs.
This helps make it easy to see that their content is information only and does not contain any regulatory requirements.

About NCC Volume One
NCC Volume One contains technical design and construction requirements for all Class 2 to 9 buildings (multi-residential,
commercial, industrial, and public assembly buildings) and their associated structures.
NCC Volume One contains the requirements for—
• all Class 2 to 9 buildings; and
• access requirements for people with a disability in Class 1b and 10a buildings; and
• certain Class 10b structures including access requirements for people with a disability in Class 10b swimming pools.
Components of NCC Volume One
NCC Volume One contains the following Sections:
• Section A – Governing Requirements
• Section B – Structure
• Section C – Fire resistance
• Section D – Access and egress
• Section E – Services and equipment
• Section F – Health and amenity
• Section G – Ancillary provisions
• Section I – Special use buildings
• Section J – Energy efficiency
• Schedules—
◾ Abbreviations and symbols
◾ Definitions
◾ Referenced documents
◾ State and Territory variations and additions
Section A contains the mandatory Governing Requirements for the NCC. Sections B to G and I to J contain the mandatory
Performance Requirements and the pathways that can be used to comply with the NCC.
There is no Section H in NCC Volume One because the letter ‘H’ is used in NCC Volume Two. This avoids number clashes
between NCC Volume One and NCC Volume Two.

Introduction to this Part
This Part explains important concepts on how the NCC must be interpreted and applied. There are certain conventions
and approaches that need to be taken into account when using the NCC. This includes interpreting specific language and
terms. This is critical to understanding the intended technical and legal meaning of the NCC. This Part also explains the
difference between the mandatory Parts of the NCC and the Parts that are only explanatory or guidance in nature.
A1G1 Scope of NCC Volume One
[New for 2022]
NCC Volume One contains the requirements for—
(a) all Class 2 to 9 buildings; and
(b) access requirements for people with a disability in Class 1b and 10a buildings; and
(c) certain Class 10b structures including access requirements for people with a disability in Class 10b swimming
pools.
A1G2 Scope of NCC Volume Two
[New for 2022]
NCC Volume Two contains the requirements for—
(a) Class 1 and 10a buildings (other than access requirements for people with a disability in Class 1b and 10a
buildings); and
(b) certain Class 10b structures (other than access requirements for people with a disability in Class 10b swimming
pools); and
(c) Class 10c private bushfire shelters.
A1G3 Scope of NCC Volume Three
[New for 2022]
(1) NCC Volume Three contains technical requirements for the design, construction, installation, replacement, repair,
alteration and maintenance for plumbing and drainage systems in new and existing buildings.
(2) NCC Volume Three applies to these systems in all classes of buildings whenever plumbing and drainage work is
carried out.
(3) NCC Volume Three additionally applies to sites where services are designed, constructed, installed, replaced,
repaired, altered and maintained independently of buildings.
(4) NCC Volume Three applies from the point of connection to the point of discharge.
A1G4 Interpretation
[2019: A1.0]
(1) The following components of the NCC are non-mandatory and informative:

Governing requirements
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 42
(2) Words in italics must be interpreted in accordance with─
(a) definitions provided in Schedule 1, unless the contrary intention appears; and
(b) additional definitions in State or Territory appendices, as appropriate.
(3) The NCC must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the following:
(a) A reference to a building is a reference to an entire building or part of a building (as the case requires).
(b) A reference to plumbing or drainage solution, or product in Volume Three is a reference to an entire installation,
system or product, or part of an installation, system or product (as the case requires).
(c) A reference in a Performance Requirement to “the degree necessary” means─
(i) that consideration of all the criteria referred to in the Performance Requirement will determine the outcome
appropriate to the circumstances; and
(ii) that in certain cases it may not be necessary to incorporate any specific measures to meet the relevant
Performance Requirement.
(d) An “Application” statement is mandatory and is provided to specify where and when a requirement or provision
applies.
(e) A “Limitation” statement is mandatory and is provided to specify where and when the application of a requirement
or provision is limited to a certain circumstance.
(f) An “Exemption” statement is mandatory and is provided to specify where or when a requirement or provision
does not need to be complied with.
(g) A “Note” is part of a provision or requirement and provides additional mandatory instructions.
(h) Figures in the NCC─
(i) are used to illustrate specific issues referenced in the associated text; and
(ii) are not to be construed as containing all design information that is required for that particular building
element or situation.
(i) The definitions, symbols and abbreviations listed in Schedule 1.
(4) A reference to a building class is a reference to all the sub-classifications of that class.
(5) The following sub-classifications apply:
(a) Classes 1a and 1b are sub-classifications of Class 1.

TAS A1G4(7)
Notes
For Volume Three, if a word is not defined in Schedule 1, the meaning (if any) attributed to it under AS/NZS 3500.0
should be used unless the contrary intention appears.
Explanatory Information
Explanatory information and Introduction information contained in the NCC is non-mandatory and is provided for
guidance purposes only. This informative material should be read in conjunction with the technical provisions of the
NCC. Any statements made in the informative and guidance components of the NCC should not be taken to override
the NCC. Unlike the NCC, which is adopted by legislation, the informative and guidance components are not called up
into legislation and they do not cover State and Territory variations and additions. Because informative and guidance
components of the NCC do not have regulatory force, the ABCB accepts no responsibility for its contents when applied
to specific buildings or any liability which may result from its use.
Defined words provide the precise meaning and expressions of key words used for understanding and complying with
the NCC. Where a word is not defined in the NCC, the relevant common meaning of the word should be used.
Generally, a reference to a building is a reference to the whole building, regardless of classification. However, when a
A1G4
 (1 May 2023)
Governing requirements
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 43
provision is applicable to a specific class or classes of building, that reference to a building may be a reference to the
whole building or part of the building depending on how the building is classified.
Classes 1a and 1b, 7a and 7b, 9a, 9b and 9c, and 10a, 10b and 10c are separate classifications. In the NCC, when the
designation ‘a’, ‘b’ or ‘c’ is not applied, the reference is to all buildings of the general class. For example, ‘Class 9b’
refers only to Class 9b buildings, but ‘Class 9’ refers to Classes 9a, 9b and 9c.
Whether a provision applies or not depends on the circumstances of the case and the circumstances in which the
reference is made. For example, where a building has a single classification, a reference to a building in the NCC is
understandably a reference to a whole building. However, where a building has parts of different classification, unless
the contrary intention appears (i.e. there is a specific reference to the whole building), a reference to a building in the
NCC is a reference to the relevant part of the building. This means that each part of the building must comply with the
relevant provisions for its classification.
A number of the Performance Requirements of the NCC use the expression “to the degree necessary” or “appropriate
to”. These expressions provide flexibility by allowing appropriate authorities to determine the degree of compliance
necessary in a particular case. Therefore, any part of the NCC that uses these expressions should be referenced against
the requirements of the appropriate authority. For example, an appropriate authority might judge that an item need not
be installed, or a particular level of performance be achieved.
Application, Limitation, and Exemption statements are used to identify provisions that may or may not apply in certain
situations, to varying degrees.
Figures are used to explain the requirements of a particular clause. To ensure the context of the requirement is clearly
understood, adjacent construction elements of the building that would normally be required in that particular situation
are not always shown. Accordingly, aspects of figures that are not shown should not be interpreted as meaning these
construction details are not required. Therefore a figure must not be used as an indication of the full construction
requirements in a given situation, as the only available option, or a substitute for referencing appropriate construction
requirements (in other sources) for a given clause.

(2) When using a combination of solutions, compliance can be shown through the following, as appropriate:
(a) A2G2 for assessment against the relevant Performance Requirements.
(b) A2G3 for assessment against the relevant Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions.
(3) Where a Performance Requirement is satisfied by a Performance Solution in combination with a Deemed-to-Satisfy
Solution, in order to comply with (1), the following method must be used to determine the Performance Requirement
or Performance Requirements relevant to the Performance Solution:
(a) Identify the relevant Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions of each Section or Part that are to be the subject of the
Performance Solution.
(b) Identify the Performance Requirements from the same Sections or Parts that are relevant to the identified
A2G2
 (1 May 2023)
Governing requirements
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 46
Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions.
(c) Identify Performance Requirements from other Sections or Parts that are relevant to any aspects of any
Performance Solution proposed or that are affected by the application of the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions that
are the subject of the Performance Solution.
Explanatory Information
To comply with the NCC, a solution must achieve compliance with the Governing Requirements and the Performance
Requirements. The Governing Requirements contain requirements about how the Performance Requirements must be
met.
Performance Requirements outline the minimum necessary standards different buildings or building elements must
attain. The Performance Requirements are the only NCC technical provisions that must be satisfied.
In some instances, State and Territory variations and additions may also be applicable to certain Performance
Requirements.
A solution may be partly a Performance Solution and partly a Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution. However, no matter what
method is chosen, building proponents need to always meet the Performance Requirements of the NCC.
A2G2(2)(b)(ii) provides for the use of Verification Methods that are not listed in the NCC. A Verification Method may
include—
• a calculation, using analytical methods or mathematical models; or
• a test, using a technical procedure, either on-site or in a laboratory, to directly measure the extent to which the
Performance Requirements have been met; or
• an inspection (and inspection report); or
• any other acceptable form of certification.
Any Verification Method used must be acceptable to the appropriate authority.
A Performance Solution must comply with all applicable Performance Requirements of the NCC. A Performance Solution
provides a tailored solution to meet the intended objective of the Performance Requirements. A Performance Solution
must comply with all relevant Performance Requirements and must be verified using one or a combination of the
following Assessment Methods:
• Evidence of suitability.
• Verification Method.
• Expert Judgement.
• Comparison with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions.
For example, building proponents who wish to know what has to be done to satisfy the fire safety Performance
Requirements for a particular building can either follow the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions or develop a Performance
Solution. Guidance on how to develop Performance Solutions can be found on the ABCB website at: www.abcb.gov.au.
The ABCB Resource Library contains information on the development of Performance Solutions for both building and
plumbing.
A Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution is achieved by following all appropriate Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions in the NCC. The
Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions are prescriptive (i.e. like a recipe book, they tell you how, what and in which location
things must be done). They include materials, components, design factors, and construction methods that, if used, are
deemed to meet the Performance Requirements, hence the term “Deemed-to-Satisfy”.
A Deemed-to-Satisfy Solution may be verified using one or a combination of the following Assessment Methods:
• Evidence of suitability.
• Expert Judgement.
Some Performance Requirements are without Deemed-to-Satisfy Solutions. Compliance with these Performance
Requirements must be achieved by using a Performance Solution.
When designing a building or plumbing or drainage system, both Performance Solutions and Deemed-to-Satisfy
Solutions can be used to achieve compliance with Performance Requirements. A combination of solutions may be used
to satisfy a single Performance Requirement. This may include occasions where a specific Performance Requirement
covers a number of elements of a building or plumbing or drainage system.
No NCC provision can be considered in isolation. Any departure from the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for a
A2G4
 (1 May 2023)
Governing requirements
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 47
Performance Solution needs to be assessed against the relevant Performance Requirements within the relevant NCC
Section or Part. Additionally, the proposed Performance Solution may also impact on other Performance Requirements
in other Sections or Parts. Thus, these additional Performance Requirements need to be considered in relation to the
subject Performance Solution. A2G2(3) and A2G4(3) set out the methods for determining which Performance
Requirements are relevant.
It is important that a holistic approach is used when determining the appropriate Performance Requirements.
A2G4(2)(a) references A2G2. Therefore, when using a combination of Performance Solutions and Deemed-to-Satisfy
Solutions it is necessary to comply with A2G2(4) where a Performance Requirement is proposed to be satisfied by a
Performance Solution.

Introduction to this Part
This Part explains applying the NCC in accordance with State or Territory legislation. The NCC has legal effect through
references in relevant State or Territory building and plumbing legislation.
Although the NCC is a nationally consistent code, there are some situations where a State or Territory enforces a variation,
addition or deletion to it. This Part also explains how these variations, additions and deletions apply.
A3G1 State and Territory compliance

(1) For application within a particular State or Territory, the volumes of the NCC comprise inclusively of—
(a) Sections A to G, I and J and associated schedules of Volume One; and
(b) Sections A and H and associated schedules of Volume Two; and
(c) Sections A to E and associated schedules of Volume Three.
(2) State and Territory variations, additions and deletions must be complied with in conjunction with the NCC.
(3) The NCC is subject to, and may be overridden by, State or Territory legislation.
(4) State and Territory variations, additions and deletions are contained in the following Schedules:
(a) Schedule 3: Commonwealth of Australia.
(b) Schedule 4: Australian Capital Territory.
(c) Schedule 5: New South Wales.
(d) Schedule 6: Northern Territory.
(e) Schedule 7: Queensland.
(f) Schedule 8: South Australia.
(g) Schedule 9: Tasmania.
(h) Schedule 10: Victoria.
(i) Schedule 11: Western Australia.
(5) State and Territory variations and deletions are identified throughout the NCC.
Explanatory Information
The NCC is given legal effect by building regulatory legislation in each State and Territory. This legislation consists of
an Act of Parliament and subordinate legislation which empowers the regulation of certain aspects of building and
plumbing, and contains the administrative provisions necessary to give effect to the legislation.
Although the NCC is a national code, in some instances it is necessary for a State or Territory to vary or apply additional
requirements specific to their jurisdiction. A3G1(2) highlights that these variations, additions or deletions must be applied
in conjunction with the NCC provisions. Typically, these variations, additions or deletions override the requirements
contained within the NCC.
Any provision of the NCC may be overridden by, or subject to, State or Territory legislation. The NCC must therefore be
read in conjunction with that legislation. Any queries on such matters should be referred to the State or Territory authority
responsible for building and plumbing regulatory matters.
Where a requirement or provision of the NCC is subject to a State or Territory variation, addition, or deletion, a reference
to the appropriate provision in the applicable State or Territory schedule is included with that requirement or provision.

NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 49
Introduction to this Part
This Part explains how documents referenced in the NCC are adopted and applied. The NCC itself does not contain details
of every design and construction requirement for a building or plumbing or drainage system. As such, the NCC calls upon
or “references” other documents with this information. These are called NCC referenced documents. Examples of such
documents are Australian Standards, ABCB protocols, ABCB standards and other publications.
There are multiple types of referenced documents. A primary referenced document is one referenced in Schedule 2 of the
NCC. A secondary referenced document is one referenced in a primary referenced document. Other referenced documents
are referenced by secondary and subsequently referenced documents.
A4G1 Referenced documents
[2019: A4.0]
(1) A reference in the NCC to a document refers to the edition or issues and any amendment listed in Schedule 2.
(2) A document referenced in the NCC is only applicable in the context in which the document is quoted.
TAS A4G1(3)
(3) Where a new edition, issue or amendment of a primary referenced document is not listed in Schedule 2, the new
edition, issue or amendment is not referenced for the purpose of the NCC.
(4) Any document referenced in a primary referenced document is known as a secondary referenced document.
(5) A reference in a primary referenced document to a secondary or other referenced document is a reference to the
document as it existed at the time of publication of the primary referenced document.
Applications
A4G1 applies to documents referenced in the ABCB Housing Provisions in the same way as for documents referenced
within any other part of the NCC.
Exemptions
If the secondary or other referenced document is also a primary referenced document, A4G1(5) does not apply.
A4G2 Differences between referenced documents and the NCC
[2019: A4.1]
The NCC overrules any difference between the NCC (including the ABCB Housing Provisions) and a primary referenced
document, including any secondary referenced document.
Applications
A4G2 applies to documents referenced in the ABCB Housing Provisions in the same way as for other documents
referenced by Volumes One, Two or Three of the NCC.

NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 50
A4G3 Adoption of referenced documents
[2019: A4.2]
The NCC does not require compliance with requirements in relation to the following matters where they are prescribed in
a referenced document:
(a) The rights, responsibilities or obligations between the manufacturer, supplier or purchaser.
(b) The responsibilities of any tradesperson or other building operative, architect, engineer, authority, or other person
or body.
(c) The submission for approval of any material, building component, form or method of construction, to any person,
authority or body other than those empowered under State or Territory legislation to give that approval.
(d) The submission of a material, product, form of construction or design to any person, authority or body for opinion.
(e) Any departure from the NCC, rule, specification or provision at the sole discretion of the manufacturer or
purchaser, or by arrangement or agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser.
Applications
A4G3 applies to documents referenced in the ABCB Housing Provisions in the same way as for documents referenced
within Volumes One, Two or Three of the NCC.
Explanatory Information
Schedule 2 is only mandatory to Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, Specifications and Verification Methods. However,
referenced documents are only applicable to the NCC provision that references the document.
A proponent undertaking a Performance Solution can use any element or edition of any document, if they help satisfy
the Performance Requirements. They do not need to use the documents listed in Schedule 2.
Schedule 2 lists the specific edition of the Standard or other document adopted, including any amendments considered
appropriate for Schedule 2, the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, Specifications or Verification Methods. Other editions of
(or amendments to) the referenced document are not adopted and have no standing under the NCC.
A primary referenced document may refer to a secondary referenced document. A4G1(5) stipulates that the secondary
referenced document is the edition of the document that existed at the time of publication of the primary referenced
document. When another edition of (or amendment to) a secondary referenced document is released, subject to the
exemption to A4G1, that edition (or amendment) is not adopted for the purposes of the primary referenced document.
A4G3 means that contractual matters or clauses defining responsibilities of various parties, and matters not appropriate
for adoption in the NCC are not included when a document is called up in the NCC.

Introduction to this Part
This Part explains the evidence needed to show that the NCC requirements are met and the solution is “fit for purpose”.
It covers the use of materials, products, forms of construction and designs. It details separate requirements for the BCA
and PCA.
Examples of evidence to be prepared and retained include certificates, reports, calculations and any other documents or
information showing compliance with the NCC requirements.
A5G1 Suitability
[2019: A5.0]
(1) A building and plumbing or drainage installation must be constructed using materials, products, plumbing products,
forms of construction and designs fit for their intended purpose to achieve the relevant requirements of the NCC.
(2) For the purposes of (1), a material, product, plumbing product, form of construction or design is fit for purpose if it
is—
(a) supported by evidence of suitability in accordance with—
(i) A5G2; and
(ii) A5G3 or A5G4 as appropriate; and
(b) constructed or installed in an appropriate manner.
Explanatory Information
A5G1 relates to the quality of work and materials needed to construct a building to meet NCC requirements.
This means that—
• all people involved with construction must work skillfully in accordance with good trade practice; and
• all materials must be of a quality to fulfil their function/s within the building.
A5G1 only applies to matters normally covered by the NCC.
While A5G1 outlines quality of work and material demands, sometimes additional conditions may be required by—
• other Commonwealth, State or Territory legislation; and
• contracts that include either specific quality requirements, or requirements for specific materials and the like.
Explanatory Information: Example
Permit authorities would ordinarily not apply A5G1 to such matters as—
• plastering — other than for fire rating, waterproofing of wet areas, and sound insulation; or
• painting — other than that required for weatherproofing an external wall.
When determining which form of evidence will be used, it is important to consider the appropriateness of the evidence,
as some forms of evidence may be more suitable to materials and products and others to designs and forms of
construction. The requirement to consider appropriateness of the evidence is specified in A5G2(1).

All copies of documents provided as evidence must be unabridged copies of the originals. No part can be left incomplete.
A5G3 Evidence of suitability ─ Volumes One and Two (BCA)
[2019: A5.2]
(1) Subject to A5G5, A5G6, A5G7 and A5G9, evidence to support that the use of a material, product, form of construction
or design meets a Performance Requirement or a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision may be in the form of any one, or
any combination of the following:
(a) A current CodeMark Australia or CodeMark Certificate of Conformity.
(b) A current Certificate of Accreditation.
(c) A current certificate, other than a certificate described in (a) and (b), issued by a certification body stating that
the properties and performance of a material, product, form of construction or design fulfil specific requirements
of the BCA.
(d) A report issued by an Accredited Testing Laboratory that—
(i) demonstrates that a material, product or form of construction fulfils specific requirements of the BCA; and
(ii) sets out the tests the material, product or form of construction has been subjected to and the results of
those tests and any other relevant information that has been relied upon to demonstrate it fulfils specific
requirements of the BCA.
(e) A certificate or report from a professional engineer or other appropriately qualified person that—
(i) certifies that a material, product, form of construction or design fulfils specific requirements of the BCA; and
(ii) sets out the basis on which it is given and the extent to which relevant standards, specifications, rules,
codes of practice or other publications have been relied upon to demonstrate it fulfils specific requirements
of the BCA.
(f) Another form of documentary evidence, such as but not limited to a Product Technical Statement, that—
(i) demonstrates that a material, product, form of construction or design fulfils specific requirements of the
BCA; and
(ii) sets out the basis on which it is given and the extent to which relevant standards, specifications, rules,
codes of practice or other publications have been relied upon to demonstrate it fulfils specific requirements
of the BCA.
(2) Evidence to support that a calculation method complies with an ABCB protocol may be in the form of any one, or any
combination of the following:
(a) A certificate from a professional engineer or other appropriately qualified person that—
(i) certifies that the calculation method complies with a relevant ABCB protocol; and
(ii) sets out the basis on which it is given and the extent to which relevant standards, specifications, rules,
codes of practice and other publications have been relied upon.
(b) Another form of documentary evidence that correctly describes how the calculation method complies with a
relevant ABCB protocol.
Applications
A5G3 is only applicable to NCC Volumes One and Two (BCA).
A5G2
 (1 May 2023)
Governing requirements
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 53
Notes
Current documentary evidence, such as a certificate or report, containing references to NCC 2019 provisions remains
valid despite amended provision references in NCC 2022, subject to technical requirements remaining the same
between editions.
Explanatory Information
A5G3 represents the minimum level of documentary evidence needed to show that a material, product, form of
construction or design meets the relevant NCC requirements. The evidence can be required by:
• an appropriate authority;
• a party to a construction contract; or
• a person certifying compliance with the NCC.
If a building proponent does not produce exactly what is required, the evidence may be rejected.
It should be noted that ‘design’ may refer to engineering design, architectural design as well as product and material
design.
A5G3(1)(f) allows for the use of alternative forms of documentary evidence to those included in A5G3(1)(a) to (e), as
long as they comply with certain specified conditions.
An example of this arises when an authority carries out an inspection of a building site. The inspection alone would not
be acceptable as evidence. However, if the authority compiled a written report detailing findings and conclusions from
the inspection, then it may comply with the requirements of A5G3(1)(f).
A Product Technical Statement detailing the characteristics and merits of a particular product or system is also an
example of another form of documentary evidence.
There is significant reliance by industry on the use of calculation methods, including software programs, for
demonstrating compliance with the NCC. While there is no formal recognition of specific methods, A5G3(2) allows
suitable evidence to be submitted to demonstrate that a calculation method (including a software program) complies
with a relevant ABCB protocol that establishes the characteristics of a suitable calculation method.
If under a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision a building element is required to have an FRL, then A5G3 may be used to
provide evidence to show that the FRL has been determined in accordance with Specification 1 and 2.
In the case of a test report from an Accredited Testing Laboratory, the report may be either—
• the test report referred to in clause 2.16.2 of AS 1530.4 (also referred to as a full test report); or
• the regulatory information report referred to in clause 2.16.3 of AS 1530.4 (also referred to as a short-form report).
In both cases the report must be an unabridged copy of the original report. A test certificate referred to in clause 2.16.4
of AS 1530.4 on its own is not suitable for showing compliance with the NCC.
If a proposal uses a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision that requires a building element to have fire hazard properties, then
A5G3 may be used to provide evidence to support the proposal and show that the fire hazard properties have been
determined in accordance with A5G6.
Refer to the guidance provided in the Guide to Volume One for further information on fire hazard properties which
includes—
• Flammability Index; and
• Spread-of-Flame Index; and
• Smoke-Developed Index; and
• a material’s group number; and
• smoke growth rate index.
The Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions of the BCA contain a number of provisions requiring a ceiling to have a resistance
to the incipient spread of fire to the space above itself. A5G7 sets out the method of determining the incipient spread
of fire. The method is based on the method of determining the FRL of a building element and use of the Standard Fire
Test.

(i) certifies that the design or system complies with the relevant requirements of the PCA; and
(ii) sets out the basis on which it is given and the extent to which relevant standards, specifications, rules,
codes of practice or other publications have been relied upon.
(c) Any other form of documentary evidence that—
(i) demonstrates that a design or system complies with the relevant requirements of the PCA; and

Applications
Products subject to the requirements of A5G4(2) are specifically nominated in the WaterMark Schedule of Products
and the WaterMark Schedule of Excluded Products.
Exemptions
(1) Products that are used exclusively for non-drinking uses such as manufacturing, industrial processing, irrigation or
any other uses where water is not anticipated to be used for human consumption are excluded from the
requirements of A5G4(2).
Explanatory Information
Some examples of products subject to A5G4(2) include the following:
• Copper alloy fittings.
• Stainless-steel braided hoses.
• Valves (such as valves for isolation, backflow prevention, alteration of pressure and temperature).
• Taps and mixers.
• Water meters.
• Pumps (for use with cold and heated water services).
• Water heaters.
• Residential water filtration equipment.
• Water dispensers (such as boiling and cooling units, drinking fountains and bottle fillers).
• Fire sprinkler systems connected to the cold water service that are not isolated from fixtures and fittings intended
to supply water for human consumption.
Some examples of products excluded from the requirements of A5G4(2) include the following:
• Shower heads for bathing.
• Emergency showers, eye wash and/or face wash equipment.
• Pumps used for irrigation, fire-fighting or other non-drinking water purposes.
• Fire-fighting water services and equipment including residential fire sprinklers.
• Appliances, including washing machines and dishwashers.
• Commercial boilers associated with heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.
• Sanitary fixtures (such as toilets, cistern inlet valves, bidets and urinals.
• Non-drinking water systems (such as recycled water systems).
Product certification transition arrangements are outlined in Notices of Direction issued through the WaterMark
Certification Scheme.
Lead is currently permitted in small proportions in the raw materials used to manufacture some plumbing products.
Whilst the allowable lead levels permitted in products manufactured prior to 1 September 2025 ensures compliance
with the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, the use of products compliant with the lead levels in A5G4(2) is
encouraged, to avoid the potential for adverse effects on human health.
A5G4(1) requires any product intended for use in contact with drinking water to comply with AS/NZS 4020. Compliance
is achieved by passing the relevant tests set out in the Standard.
Evidence of compliance must then be provided in accordance with A5G4(1), under which there are two options. The
first, at A5G4(1)(a), recognises test reports and certificates that cover compliance with AS/NZS 4020 only. The second,
at A5G4(1)(b), recognises WaterMark Licences where compliance with AS/NZS 4020 is a requirement of the relevant
product Standard or WaterMark Technical Specification.
For products that are of a type listed on the WaterMark Schedule of Products, A5G4(2) requires that these products
have a WaterMark Licence. A WaterMark Licence reflects that the product has been certified and authorised in
accordance with the WaterMark Scheme Rules.
For products that are not subject to WaterMark certification (i.e. excluded products), evidence that can be used to
A5G4
 (1 May 2023)
Governing requirements
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 56
support that the product is fit for its intended purpose is provided in A5G4(3). This may include demonstrating compliance
with a product specification referenced in the WaterMark Schedule of Excluded Products, where one is available.
A5G4(4) provides that any product that is not listed on the WaterMark Schedule of Products or the WaterMark Schedule
of Excluded Products must be subjected to a risk assessment in accordance with the WaterMark Scheme Rules. The
risk assessment will determine whether the product in question requires certification and authorisation, or if it should
be listed as an “excluded product”. This in turn will determine the form of evidence of suitability applicable to the product.
Explanatory Information: What is WaterMark?
The WaterMark Certification Scheme is a mandatory certification scheme for plumbing and drainage products to ensure
that these products are fit for purpose and appropriately authorised for use in a plumbing or drainage system.
The PCA, through Part A5, requires certain plumbing and drainage products to be certified and authorised for use in a
plumbing or drainage system. These products are certified through the WaterMark Certification Scheme and listed on
the WaterMark Product Database.
The WaterMark Certification Scheme is governed by the WaterMark Scheme Rules, which are available for download
from the ABCB website at: www.abcb.gov.au. These rules set out the requirements for risk assessments, evaluation,
certification, and the drafting of WaterMark Technical Specifications.
When a product is listed on the WaterMark Schedule of Products then, for it to be certified and authorised, the product
must—
• be tested by an Accredited Testing Laboratory; and
• comply with an approved product specification (either a relevant existing product Standard or a WaterMark Technical
Specification); and
• be manufactured in accordance with an approved Quality Assurance Program; and
• carry a scope of use.
Products that comply fully with the applicable requirements of the WaterMark Certification Scheme are then eligible to
be certified by a WaterMark Conformity Assessment Body and listed on the WaterMark Product Database. Certified
products are identifiable by the WaterMark certification trade mark, shown in Figure A5G4 below, that must be displayed
on the product upon granting of a WaterMark Licence.

Introduction to this Part
The NCC groups buildings and structures by the purpose for which they are designed, constructed or adapted to be used,
assigning each type of building or structure with a classification. This Part explains how each building classification is
defined and used in the NCC.
The building classifications are labelled “Class 1” through to “Class 10”. Some classifications also have sub-classifications,
referred to by a letter after the number (e.g. Class 1a).
The technical building requirements for Class 2 to 9 buildings are mostly covered by Volume One of the NCC and those
for Class 1 and 10 are mostly covered by Volume Two of the NCC. Volume Three of the NCC covers plumbing and drainage
requirements for all building classifications.
A building may have parts that have been designed, constructed or adapted for different purposes. In most cases, each
of these parts is a separate classification. A building (or part of a building) may also have more than one such purpose
and may be assigned more than one classification.
A6G1 Determining a building classification
[2019: A6.0]
(1) The classification of a building or part of a building is determined by the purpose for which it is designed, constructed
or adapted to be used.
(2) Each part of a building must be classified according to its purpose and comply with all the appropriate requirements
for its classification.
(3) A room that contains a mechanical, thermal or electrical facility or the like that serves the building must have the
same classification as the major part or principal use of the building or fire compartment in which it is situated.
(4) Unless another classification is more suitable, an occupiable outdoor area must have the same classification as the
part of the building to which it is associated.
Exemptions
(1) For A6G1(1) where a part of a building has been designed, constructed or adapted for a different purpose and is
less than 10% of the floor area of the storey it is situated on, the classification of the other part of the storey may
apply to the whole storey.
(2) A6G1(3) does not apply to an electricity network substation.
Limitations
Exemption (1) does not apply where the minor use of a building is a laboratory, a Class 9b early childhood centre, or a
Class 2, 3 or 4 part of a building.
Explanatory Information
Classification is a process for understanding risks in a building or part, according to its use. It must be correctly
undertaken to achieve NCC aims as appropriate to each building in each circumstance.
It is possible for a single building to have parts with different classifications. Part of a building can also have more than
one classification. Where there is any conflict between what requirements the part should comply with, the more stringent
requirement applies.
Where it is unclear which classification should apply, appropriate authorities have the discretion to decide. They base
their decision on an assessment of the building proposal.

Governing Requirements

NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 59
They will look at what classification the building most closely resembles. They will also take into account the likely fire
load, plus, the likely consequences of any risks to the safety, health and amenity of people using the building.
Appropriate authorities will also look at any relevant court decisions or determinations of the State or Territory body
responsible for considering appeals on building classification matters.
It should be noted that appeals body determinations and, in some States and Territories, certain court decisions are
usually not precedent creating. Such decisions are determined on a case-by-case basis.
It should also be noted that State and Territory authorities responsible for building regulatory matters may have issued
advice, interpretations or guidelines to assist practitioners in applying the correct classification to a building or part.
Advice on such matters should be sought from the relevant authority.
Under Exemption (1) to A6G1, if 10% or less of the floor area of a storey is used for a purpose which could be classified
differently to the remainder of that storey, that part may be classified as being the same as the remainder. Laboratories,
sole-occupancy units in Class 2, 3 or 4 parts, and Class 9b early childhood centres are excluded from this concession
(see Limitation to A6G1). The reason is that laboratories are considered to have a high fire hazard potential and
classifying them with the remainder of the building could, in a majority of cases, endanger occupants of the other parts
of the building which have a lower fire hazard potential. In relation to Class 9b early childhood centres, the intent is to
ensure that these facilities cannot be regarded as another class and that the specific fire safety requirements applicable
to Class 9b early childhood centres are implemented. Also, the intent is not to allow sole-occupancy units in Class 2, 3
or 4 parts to be regarded as another Class such as Class 6 and then not have any fire or sound insulation between the
units and any other classification which may have a high fire load and could endanger the occupants of the Class 2, 3
or 4 part.
If Exemption (1) to A6G1 is used, it should be remembered that it will still be necessary to use the occupant numbers
in Volume One Table D2D18 for the particular use of the area. Likewise, the lighting and equipment levels, people
occupancy and load profiles for the area of minor use for the purposes of Volume One Section J must be in accordance
with the use of the area.
If the storey has a very large floor area, the 10% or less concession area may also be large, even though the rest of
the building is classifiable as a building which ordinarily has a lower risk potential. An example of the application of this
area concession could be as follows:
• If a single storey factory has an office that takes up 8% of the whole storey’s floor area, the entire building (including
the office) can be classified as being Class 8.
• However, if that office area takes up 12% of the storey’s floor area, that area must be classified as Class 5, and the
remainder of the building as Class 8.
Under A6G1(3) a plant room, machinery room, lift motor room or boiler room, have the same classification as the part
of the building they are in. These kinds of rooms do not need to be ancillary or subordinate to the part of the building
they are in, that is, the 10% criterion is not applicable.
There are specific provisions for these kinds of rooms. For example, Volume One Section C requires some of them to
be fire separated from the remainder of the building (e.g. see C3D14 with regard to elements of the electricity supply
system).
A6G2 Class 1 buildings
[2019: A6.1]
(1) A Class 1 building is a dwelling.
(2) Class 1 includes the following sub-classifications:
(a) Class 1a is one or more buildings, which together form a single dwelling including the following:
(i) A detached house.
(ii) One of a group of two or more attached dwellings, each being a building, separated by a fire-resisting wall,
including a row house, terrace house, town house or villa unit.
(b) Class 1b is one or more buildings which together constitute—
(i) a boarding house, guest house, hostel or the like that—
(A) would ordinarily accommodate not more than 12 people; and
have a total area of all floors not more than 300 m2 (B) (measured over the enclosing walls of the building
or buildings); or

Notes
Figures A6G2a, A6G2b and A6G2c illustrates requirements of this provision.
Limitations
For A6G2, a Class 1 building cannot be located above or below another dwelling or another class of building, other
than a private garage.
Explanatory Information
Class 1 buildings are primarily covered in Volumes Two and Three of the NCC. Class 1 buildings are not located above
or below another dwelling, or another class of building other than a private garage.
A sole-occupancy unit used for residential purposes located over another sole-occupancy unit used for residential
purposes will always be a Class 2 or Class 3 building (depending on the circumstances). It cannot be a Class 1 building.
A single Class 1 dwelling can be made up of more than one building. For example, it may include what is ordinarily
called a house, plus one or more habitable ‘outbuildings’ such as sleepouts. Note that a habitable building such as a
sleepout cannot be classified as a Class 10 building.
The height or number of storeys of a Class 1 building makes no difference to its classification.
Class 1b buildings used for short-term holiday accommodation include cabins in caravan parks, tourist parks, farm stay,
holiday resorts and similar tourist accommodation. This accommodation itself is typically rented out on a commercial
basis for short periods and generally does not require the signing of a lease agreement. Short-term accommodation
can also be provided in a boarding house, guest house, hostel, bed and breakfast accommodation or the like.
Unlike a Class 1b building described in A6G2(2)(a), a Class 1b building described in A6G2(2)(b) does not have any
floor area limitation. Therefore, if 4 or more single dwellings are located on the one allotment and used for short-term
holiday accommodation, each single dwelling would be classified as a Class 1b building regardless of the floor area of
each dwelling or the combined floor area of all of the dwellings.
See also Volume One D4D2(3) which contains an explanation of what is considered to be “one allotment”.
The Class 1b classification can attract concessions applicable to Class 3 buildings. These concessions allow people to
rent out rooms in a house, or run a bed and breakfast, without having to comply with the more stringent Class 3
requirements. The reasoning is that the smaller size of the building and its lower number of occupants represents
reduced fire risks.

Apart from their use, the primary difference between Class 1a and Class 1b buildings is that the latter is required to
have a greater number of smoke alarms and in some circumstances, access and features for people with a disability.
A6G3 Class 2 buildings
[2019: A6.2]
(1) A Class 2 building is a building containing two or more sole-occupancy units.
(2) Each sole-occupancy unit in a Class 2 building must be a separate dwelling.
Explanatory Information
A Class 2 building is one that includes more than one dwelling, each of which is generally solely occupied by one or
more people to the exclusion of others.
Such buildings must not be otherwise classified as a Class 1 or Class 3 building or Class 4 part. See Explanatory Figure
A6G3a for a typical configuration of Class 1 and Class 2 buildings.
Where a sole-occupancy residential unit is located above another sole-occupancy residential unit, the building containing
the units can be either a Class 2 or a Class 3 building, depending on the other circumstances of the building proposal.
Class 2 buildings can be single storey attached dwellings. Where there is any common space below such dwellings,
they are Class 2 (and cannot be Class 1) irrespective of whether the space below is a storey or not (see Explanatory
Figure A6G3b).
Class 2 buildings can be attached to buildings of another class. The attached Class 2 buildings need not be attached
to one another, and need not be more than a single storey.
When two or more dwellings are attached to another class, they cannot be Class 4 parts, as any building can only
contain one Class 4 dwelling.

A6G4 Class 3 buildings
[2019: A6.3]
(1) A Class 3 building is a residential building providing long-term or transient accommodation for a number of unrelated
persons.
(2) Class 3 buildings include the following:
(a) A boarding house, guest house, hostel, lodging house or backpacker accommodation.
(b) A residential part of a hotel or motel.
(c) A residential part of a school.
(d) Accommodation for the aged, children, or people with disability.
(e) A residential part of a health-care building which accommodates members of staff.
(f) A residential part of a detention centre.
(g) A residential care building.
Limitations
For A6G4, a Class 3 building is not a Class 1 or 2 building but may be a mixture of Class 3 and another class.
Explanatory Information
Class 3 buildings provide accommodation for unrelated people. The length of stay is unimportant.
Some exceptions to this classification include: certain bed and breakfast accommodation, boarding houses, guest
houses, hostels, or lodging houses and the like which fall within the concession provided for Class 1b buildings.
Also, any sized building can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if it is used to house any number of unrelated people
who jointly own or rent it, or share it on a non-rental basis with an owner or tenant.
It is not unusual for a manager’s, owner’s or caretaker’s dwelling attached to a Class 3 building to be thought of as a
Class 4 part of the Class 3 building. However, a Class 4 part of a building can only be part of a Class 5-9 building.
Accordingly, such dwellings are either classified as Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3, depending on the circumstances of the
building proposal. However, a building could be a mixture of Class 3 and another class.
Class 3 buildings include—
• the residential parts of hotels and motels; and
• hotel or motel caretakers’, managers’ or owners’ flats, noting that under certain circumstances such dwellings could

be Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3 buildings; and
• dormitory accommodation, in schools or elsewhere, noting that a dormitory is generally (but not always) considered
to be a sole-occupancy unit; and
• bed and breakfast accommodation, a boarding house, guest house, hostel, or lodging house; and
• backpackers’ accommodation; and
• a building which houses elderly people or other people who require special care (in some States or Territories it is
not acceptable for a Class 1b building to be used to house elderly people or other people who require special care
- it is recommended the local building regulatory body be consulted); and
• workers’ quarters, including shearers’ or fruit pickers’ accommodation, or hotel workers’ accommodation.
A6G5 Class 4 buildings
[2019: A6.4]
Class 4 is a dwelling in a Class 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 building if it is the only dwelling in the building.
Explanatory Information
Class 4 classification applies to some types of accommodation located within a Class 5-9 building. The most common
include a caretaker’s flat within a building; and accommodation over or otherwise connected to a shop.
A Class 4 part cannot be located within a Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3 building. There can only be one Class 4 dwelling
in a building. If there are two or more dwellings, they are Class 1, Class 2, or possibly Class 3. These Class 1, Class 2
or Class 3 parts need not be attached to one another, nor be more than a single storey.
Where a Class 4 part of a building is rented out for accommodation purposes, it retains its Class 4 classification.
However, if any other part of the principal building is used for accommodation, for example, the attached shop is
converted into an additional flat, both flats become classifiable as Class 2 or, depending on their use, possibly Class 3.
A6G6 Class 5 buildings
[2019: A6.5]
A Class 5 building is an office building used for professional or commercial purposes.
Explanatory Information
Class 5 buildings include professional chambers or suites, lawyers’ offices, government offices, advertising agencies
and accountants’ offices.

A6G7 Class 6 buildings
[2019: A6.6]
(1) A Class 6 building is a shop or other building used for the sale of goods by retail or the supply of services direct to
the public.
(2) Class 6 buildings include the following:
(a) An eating room, cafe, restaurant, milk or soft-drink bar.
(b) A dining room, bar area that is not an assembly building, shop or kiosk part of a hotel or motel.
(c) A hairdresser’s or barber’s shop, public laundry, or undertaker’s establishment.
(d) A supermarket or sale room, showroom, or service station.
A6G4
 (1 May 2023)
Governing requirements
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 65
Explanatory Information
A Class 6 building is a building where goods or services are directly sold or supplied to the public. Examples of a Class
6 building may include—
• a place where food or drink may be purchased such as a café or restaurant; or
• a dining room, bar area that is not an assembly building, shop or kiosk part of a hotel or motel; or
• a hairdresser’s or barber’s shop, public laundry, veterinarian; or
• supermarket or sale room, florist, showroom, or service station.
Service stations are Class 6 buildings. These are outlets used for the servicing of cars and the selling of fuel or other
goods. The expression ‘service station’ is not intended to cover buildings where panel beating, auto electrical, muffler
replacement, tyre replacement and the like are solely carried out. Such buildings should be classified as Class 6, Class
7 or Class 8 buildings as the appropriate authority sees fit.
A6G8 Class 7 buildings
[2019: A6.7]
(1) A Class 7 building is a storage-type building.
(2) Class 7 includes the following sub-classifications:
(a) Class 7a — a carpark.
(b) Class 7b — a building that is used for storage, or display of goods or produce for sale by wholesale.
Explanatory Information
There are three basic types of Class 7 building. The first is a carpark as defined in the NCC. The second is a building
used for storage, often referred to as a ‘warehouse’. The third is a building used for the display of goods or produce for
sale by wholesale. ‘Wholesale’ means sale to people in the trades or in the business of ‘on-selling’ goods and services
to another party (including the public).
A6G9 Class 8 buildings
[2019: A6.8]
(1) A Class 8 building is a process-type building.
(2) Class 8 buildings include the following:
(a) A laboratory.
(b) A building in which the production, assembling, altering, repairing, packing, finishing, or cleaning of goods or
produce for sale takes place.
Explanatory Information
The most common way to describe a Class 8 building is as a ‘factory’. However, this can give a simplistic impression
of the types of building which can fall within this classification.
For example—
• some laboratories, despite their often small size, have been included as Class 8 buildings principally because of
their high fire hazard; and
• buildings used for altering or repairing (except service stations, which are specifically included in A6G7 as Class 6
buildings); and
• potteries; and
• food manufacturers (but not restaurants, which are specifically included in A6G7 as Class 6 buildings); and
• buildings used for the packing or processing of produce, such as a farm or horticultural building.

A6G10 Class 9 buildings
[2019: A6.9]
(1) A Class 9 building is a building of a public nature.
(2) Class 9 includes the following sub-classifications:
(a) Class 9a — a health-care building including any parts of the building set aside as laboratories, and includes a
health-care building used as a residential care building.
(b) Class 9b — an assembly building including a trade workshop or laboratory in a primary or secondary school.
(c) Class 9c — a residential care building.
Exemptions
A6G10(2)(b) excludes any parts of the building that are of another Class.
Explanatory Information
Class 9a buildings are health-care buildings, including day-care surgeries or procedure units and the like. See definition
of health-care building. Laboratories that are part of a Class 9a building are Class 9a, despite the general classification
of laboratories as Class 8 buildings.
Class 9b buildings are assembly buildings.
These buildings can include—
• theatres, cinemas and halls, churches, schools, early childhood centres, kindergartens, preschools and childminding centres; and
• indoor cricket, tennis, basketball centres and sport stadiums; and
• nightclubs, discotheques, bar areas providing live entertainment and/or containing a dance floor, public halls, dance
halls and other places of entertainment; and
• snooker halls; and
• bus and railway stations.
Regarding the Exemption to A6G10(2)(b), a building could be a mixture of Class 9b and another class, or a Class 9b
building could contain parts that are of another class, but be taken as a Class 9b building because of Exemption (1) to
A6G1.
Class 9c buildings are residential care buildings that may contain residents who have various care level needs.
The Class 9c classification recognises that many residents progress through a continuum of care needs from low to
high. Many older people enter residential care with low care needs (typically Class 3 facilities) but, as they age, require
higher levels of care. In the past, such progression often necessitated the transfer of a hostel resident (Class 3) to a
nursing home (Class 9a). This frequently had negative consequences for the health and well-being of the resident, for
whom the hostel accommodation was home. It also led, at times, to the separation of couples with differing care needs.
Building designers should note that Class 3 buildings include hostels for the accommodation of the aged, and Class 9a
buildings include nursing homes. It is important to be aware, however, that construction of Class 3 or 9a buildings may
restrict the options available to the operators of a facility in relation to the profile of the residents they wish to
accommodate. Where the potential exists for residents of varying care needs to be accommodated, consideration of
the Class 9c provisions may be appropriate. The Class 9c classification allows for any mix of low and high care residents
and is intended to allow the mix to change as the residents’ care needs change over time, without the need to obtain
any further consent or approval from the appropriate authority.
Multi-care level facilities are for residents who may require the full range of care services outlined by the Aged Care
Act. Hence, it is not intended to restrict the resident type and provides maximum flexibility for service providers, residents
and the community.
The NCC provisions for Class 9c buildings are based on minimal on duty on-site staff being available at any time.
However, it is recognised that the staff numbers vary throughout the course of any one day, due to the care needs of
the residents and the functioning of the facility. It is also recognised that the specific care needs of the residents may
result in a greater minimum number of staff.

A6G11 Class 10 buildings and structures
[2019: A6.10]
(1) A Class 10 building is a non-habitable building or structure.
(2) Class 10 includes the following sub-classifications:
(a) Class 10a is a non-habitable building including a private garage, carport, shed or the like.
(b) Class 10b is a structure that is a fence, mast, antenna, retaining wall or free-standing wall or swimming pool or
the like.
(c) Class 10c is a private bushfire shelter.
Explanatory Information
Class 10a buildings are non-habitable buildings. See Explanatory Figure A6G11 for an indication of some Class 10
building configurations.
Class 10b structures are non-habitable structures. There is no requirement for Class 10 buildings to be appurtenant to
a building of any other Class, for example, a small shed standing on its own on an allotment and a toilet block in a park.
A habitable ‘outbuilding’ which is appurtenant to another building is generally part of that building. Again, habitable
‘outbuildings’ cannot be classified as Class 10 buildings.
Typical outbuilding classifications include the following:
• A sleepout on the same allotment as a Class 1 building is part of the Class 1 building.
• A detached entertainment room on the same allotment as a Class 1 building, perhaps associated with a swimming
pool, is part of the Class 1 building.
• A small toolshed, used for trade-related hobbies for non-commercial purposes or home repairs, on the same
allotment as a Class 1 building, would be classified as a Class 10 building.
Provisions relating to Class 10c structures are only intended to address private bushfire shelters associated with a
single Class 1a dwelling. These provisions are contained in Volume Two of the NCC.
Some States or Territories may exempt some Class 10 buildings or structures (often on the basis of height or size) from
the need to have a building permit. Queries on this matter should be referred to the State or Territory body responsible
for regulatory matters.

A6G12 Multiple classifications
[2019: A6.11]
A building (or part of a building) may be designed, constructed or adapted for multiple purposes and have more than one
classification.
Applications
For A6G12, a building (or part of a building) must comply with all the relevant requirements that apply to each of the
classifications for that building (or part of a building).
Explanatory Information: Difficult classifications — Class 2 or Class 3?
There is a fine line between a Class 2 building containing apartments or flats and a Class 3 motel building with units
containing bathroom, laundry and cooking facilities, which may both be made available for short term holiday rental.
When does a Class 3 motel unit become a Class 2 holiday flat and vice versa?
In general, an assessment will be based on the most likely use of the building by appropriate authorities.
Class 3 buildings, where the occupants are generally unfamiliar with the building and have minimum control over the
safety of the building, represent a higher risk level and therefore require higher safety levels. In a case where the
classification is unclear, a decision should be made according to the perceived risks inherent in the use of the building.
Explanatory Information: Difficult classifications — Class 6 or Class 7?
Class 7 buildings include those used to sell goods on the wholesale market, whereas Class 6 buildings are used to sell
goods to the public.
Some establishments claim to sell goods to both the wholesale and retail markets. As a rule, however, if the general
public has access to the building, it is considered a ‘shop’, and therefore a Class 6 building.
Explanatory Information: Difficult classifications — Hotel bars: Class 6 or 9b?
As can be seen from the definition of a Class 6 building, it includes a hotel bar which is not an assembly building. The
bar includes the bar area and associated standing and seating areas. This clarifies that the bar extends beyond the
serving area to include standing and sitting areas where patrons may drink alcohol or other beverages and consume
food. The exclusion of an assembly building means that a bar providing live entertainment or containing a dance floor
is not considered to be Class 6; it must be considered as Class 9b. However, when that use is minor compared with the
remainder of the bar, such as a piano bar or the like where patrons only listen to music and there is no dance floor, the
appropriate authority should exercise judgement on the predominant use and therefore the appropriate classification of
the bar.
A Class 9b building is an assembly building which is defined to include a building where people may assemble for
entertainment, recreational or sporting purposes.
A building may have more than one classification (see A6G12).
Explanatory Information: Buildings used for farming purposes
Buildings used for farming-type purposes are often very diverse in nature, occupancy, use and size. In some States or
Territories, appropriate authorities may classify farm buildings as Class 10a, which covers non-habitable buildings. They
would only make this decision if a classification of Class 7 or Class 8 would not be more appropriate.
When making their decision they consider the building’s size, purpose, operations and the extent to which people are
employed in the building. For example, it may be appropriate to classify a shed which is used to store a tractor as a
Class 10a building.
The NCC has definitions of farm building and farm shed which are certain Class 7 and 8 buildings used for farming
purposes. Concessions to specific Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions apply to farm buildings and farm sheds in recognition
of their often low risk features, and it is recommended that reference is made to the definitions of farm building and
farm shed for further guidance which may assist determination of an appropriate NCC classification.
For example, if people are likely to be employed to stack materials/produce in a storage building or remove
materials/produce from a storage building then a classification of Class 7b may be appropriate. Depending upon whether
A6G12
 (1 May 2023)
Governing requirements
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 69
the criteria in the definition of farm shed or farm building have been met, the associated Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions
in NCC Volume One Part I3 may apply.
Similarly if people are likely to be employed to pack or process materials/produce within a building, or employed to
feed, clean or collect produce from animals or plants within a building then a classification of Class 8 may be appropriate.
Depending upon whether the criteria in the definition of farm shed or farm building have been met, the associated
Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions in NCC Volume One Part I3 may apply.
However identification of low fire load, low occupant risk and low risk of fire spread should not be used as justification
for choosing a less stringent building classification for a building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions. For example,
if the intended use of a building is to grow or store a large amount of tomatoes, such as a large greenhouse, and there
is likely to be only one to two persons in the building at any time, it is considered inappropriate to classify the building
as a Class 10a under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions and a classification of Class 7 or Class 8 would be more
appropriate.
The Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for a Class 7 or Class 8 farm building or farm shed do not prevent the ability to
consider or develop a Performance Solution for a particular building where the requirements may not be considered
appropriate or are viewed as too stringent. Similarly if a Class 7 or 8 building used for farming purposes does not meet
all the criteria to be considered a farm building or farm shed under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, this would not
limit the ability to develop a Performance Solution which could contain features similar to those allowed under the
Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for farm buildings or farm sheds.
For example, if a Class 8 commercial poultry building meets all the criteria to be considered a farm building under the
Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions other than the maximum floor area criteria, a Performance Solution could be developed
to demonstrate that the concessions for a farm building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions are appropriate.
In regards to a farm building or farm shed where the purpose of the building is to park farm vehicles when not in use,
as well as perhaps clean or polish the vehicle(s), it may be appropriate that this type of building is classified as a Class
7a.
However, a number of farm buildings and farm sheds are often not only used for the storage of farm vehicles, but to
store supplies such as fuel, grain or hay. A Class 7a classification may still be appropriate where the majority of the
shed’s space is intended to be designated for the parking of vehicles. However, it may be more appropriate to classify
some types of buildings as Class 7b, rather than Class 7a where a mixed use shed is intended.
Under A6G12 each part of a building (including the entire building) may have more than one classification. This means,
for example, that it is permissible to classify part of a building as a Class 6/7 building, or a Class 5/6 building, or whatever
is appropriate.
It is expected that this approach may be taken by a builder who is uncertain of what the precise use of a building will
be after its sale, or to maximise the flexibility of the building’s use.
Under the Application to A6G12, where a building has more than one classification the more stringent Class
requirements will apply.

NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 70
Introduction to this Part
This Part explains how multiple buildings can be considered as a united building. Where adjacent buildings are joined
through openings in walls, they need not meet additional requirements if they jointly comply with the NCC as a single
building.
A7G1 United buildings
[2019: A7.0]
Buildings are deemed united when two or more buildings adjoining each other are connected and used as one building.
Applications
(1) For A7G1, two or more buildings are a united building if they are connected through openings in the walls dividing
them and together comply with all the requirements of the NCC as though they are a single building.
(2) A7G1 only applies to Class 2 to 9 buildings.
A7G2 Alterations in a united building
[2019: A7.1]
If, after alterations or any other building work, two or more of the buildings in A7G1 cease to be connected through openings
in the dividing walls, each of those buildings not now connected must comply with all the requirements for a single building.
Explanatory Information
It is not unusual for authorities to receive plans proposing the connecting of two or more buildings. Connecting buildings
could be achieved by breaking openings through walls, or by joining the buildings by a tunnel, bridge or covered walkway.
When connected, if the buildings jointly comply with all the requirements of the NCC applying as if they were a single
building, they become a united building.
United buildings are not required to comply with additional NCC provisions. For example, any new openings do not
require any form of fire protection not required of a single building.
Note, however, an external wall, which as a result of an interconnection becomes an internal wall, must comply with the
requirements for an internal wall.
Interconnected buildings that do not jointly comply with all the requirements applicable to a single building, remain as
separate buildings.
This raises the possible need for fire doors, or other forms of protection to be fitted to connecting openings.
Explanatory Information: Multiple allotments or ownership
The NCC does not concern itself with actually prohibiting or permitting the uniting of buildings in separate ownership or
on separate allotments. Such matters are dealt with by the relevant local bodies.
Explanatory Information: Example of connection by bridge
In this example, Building A is connected to Building B by bridge C. There are four different options for designing such
a proposal.
The first is a united building:
Part A7 United buildings
Governing Requirements
 (1 May 2023)
Governing requirements
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 71
A, B and C are considered as a single structure and comply with the NCC.
The second is three separate buildings:
A, B and C are a fire-source feature to each of the others, and are separated by fire walls with the openings protected
at the points of connection. In this case, C may require independent support and separate egress to a road or open
space, that is not through Buildings A or B. In this case, attention should also be paid to the length of the bridge, as
regards distance of travel to an exit.
The third option is the bridge as a portion of Building A:
In this option, A and C are one building, meeting all requirements of the NCC as a single or united building. B is a
separate building, with suitable fire separation, including fire-doors at the point of interconnection. Bridge C could be
supported off Building A, but not off Building B.
The fourth option is having the bridge as a portion of Building B:
In this option, B and C are one building, meeting all requirements of the NCC as a single or united building. A is a
separate building, with suitable fire separation, including fire doors at the point of interconnection. Bridge C could be
supported off Building B, but not off Building A.
In some cases, C will link A and B across a public road, including laneways and the like. Special approvals may be
required from various appropriate authorities. However, in such cases—
• if C is supported by means other than off A and B, such support will generally only be permitted if there is no
obstruction of the public road; and
• care will need to be taken in calculating the distance of travel to an exit if travel is required to be over C and the
road is wide; and
• fire-separation may be necessary at each end of the bridge.
If the last stipulation is the case, the following matters need consideration:
• The bridge would probably need to be of fire-rated construction because combustible construction could provide a
ready path for the transfer of fire, and non-combustible construction could, in a major fire, distort and collapse onto
the road.
• The designer needs to take care that the bridge does not negate the fire separation between the storeys of the
building.

(2) Performance-based design brief (PBDB):
(a) When using this Verification Method, the fire safety engineer must undertake a performance-based design brief
(PBDB) that must—
(i) involve all stakeholders relevant to the building design; and
(ii) outline the fire strategy to be adopted.
(b) While full agreement on all aspects of the PBDB is the preferred outcome, it is acknowledged that in some
instances this may not be possible to obtain.
(c) In the event that full agreement cannot be achieved through the PBDB, dissenting views must be appropriately
recorded and carried throughout the process and considered as part of the due processes of the appropriate
authority when determining compliance and providing approval.
(d) Consideration of whether a peer review (by an independent fire safety engineer) of some or all of the proposed
Performance Solutions and the supporting analysis is required or not, must be undertaken at this PBDB stage.
(3) Fire strategy:
(a) The PBDB must cover the fire safety strategy for the building, outlining the philosophy and approach that will be
adopted to achieve the required level of performance.
(b) The fire safety strategy must pay particular attention to the evacuation strategy to be used and the management
regimes necessary.
(4) Stakeholder involvement:
(a) The PBDB must be developed collaboratively by the relevant stakeholders in the particular project.
(b) The following parties must be involved:
(i) Client or client’s representative (such as project manager).
(ii) Fire engineer.
(iii) Architect or designer.
(iv) Various specialist consultants.
(v) Fire service (public or private).
(vi) Appropriate authority (Authority Having Jurisdiction – subject to state/territory legislation).
(vii) Tenants or tenants representative for the proposed building (if available)
(viii) Building operations management (if available).
(c) Conducting a simple stakeholder analysis can be used to determine who must be involved in the PBDB process.
(d) This analysis must identify stakeholders with a high level of interest in the design process, and/or likely to be
affected by the consequences of a fire should it occur in the building.
(5) Required level of safety:
(a) Given the absence of specific safety targets in the NCC and the qualitative nature of the NCC fire safety
Performance Requirements, for this Verification Method to ensure the level of safety expected, the proposed
building design must be at least equivalent to the relevant Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions.
(b) As the NCC Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions evolved originally from State and Territory regulations and are
regularly updated to reflect technical advances and experience they are commonly accepted as providing an
acceptable benchmark.
(c) It is accepted that the NCC Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions reflect societal expectations in terms of fire safety,
which address individual risk, societal risk and the robustness in the design by adopting a defence in depth
approach.
(d) In the majority of design scenarios the Verification Method requires a demonstration that the proposed level of
safety is at least equivalent to the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions.
(e) In relation to the required level of safety, the PBDB process must—
(i) identify the relevant Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions to be used in the equivalency process to determine
whether the relevant Performance Requirements have been met; and
(ii) consider the specific size, complexity and use of the building with regards to the Deemed-to-Satisfy
Provisions to be used in the equivalency process; and
C1V4
 (1 May 2023)
Fire resistance
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 107
(iii) consider the specific occupant profile of the building, paying particular attention to occupants with a disability
and the vulnerable, in regards to the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions to be used in the equivalency process.
(6) Final report: Once the analysis of all relevant design scenarios for all the required Performance Solutions has been
completed, the fire safety engineer must prepare a final report that includes the following:
(a) The agreed PBDB.
(b) All modelling and analysis.
(c) Analysis required to demonstrate that the proposed building provides a level of safety at least equivalent to the
relevant Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions.
(d) Any other information required to clearly demonstrate that the building and its fire safety system satisfies the
relevant Performance Requirements as set out in the Fire Safety Verification Method Standard.
Explanatory Information
When developing a Performance Solution, a PBDB is an important step in the process. It allows all relevant stakeholders
to be involved in the development of the building design and its fire safety system.
A PBDB is a documented process that defines the scope of work for the fire engineering analysis. Its purpose is to set
down the basis, as agreed by the relevant stakeholders, on which the fire safety analysis of the proposed building and
its Performance Solutions will be undertaken.
Relevant stakeholders will vary from design to design. However, some examples of relevant stakeholders are: a fire
safety engineer, architect, developer, client, appropriate authority (some state legislation prevents appropriate authorities
from being involved in the design process), fire authority and other stakeholders that fire safety design may affect such
as insurers. Further information on the relevant stakeholders is provided in the Fire Safety Verification Method Standard.
Guidance on the development of a PBDB is presented in the Australian Fire Engineering Guidelines.

Testing must be carried out on either—
(a) construction in-situ; or
(b) a laboratory specimen of the construction.
S6C8 Testing in-situ
[2019: Spec C1.8: 4.2]
If testing is carried out in-situ, it must be done on that part of the construction least likely, because of the particular
combination of the height of the walls, the support conditions and other aspects of the construction, to resist the loads.
S6C9 Testing of specimens
[2019: Spec C1.8: 4.3]
If a laboratory specimen is tested, the specimen must span only in the direction corresponding to the height of the wall
and testing must be done in accordance with either (a) or (b) below:
(a) The test specimen—
(i) height (or length, if the specimen is tested horizontally) must be identical with the height between supports
in the actual construction; and
(ii) must be supported at the top and bottom (or at each end if tested horizontally) by components identical
Test Specimens
S6C5
 (1 May 2023)
Fire resistance
NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 151
with, and in a manner identical with, the actual construction.
(b) If the distance between supports of the actual construction is more than 3 m, then a smaller specimen may be
tested but—
(i) the distance between supports must be not less than 3 m; and
(ii) forces, reactions and support conditions must be modelled so as to reproduce the behaviour of the actual
construction if it were tested in-situ.
S6C10 Test methods
[2019: Spec C1.8: 5]
Tests must be carried out in accordance with the following:
(a) Material tests — The methods specified for the constituent materials of the construction of the standards adopted
by reference in the NCC.
(b) For resistance to static pressure — The provisions for testing walls under transverse load in ASTM E72-15,
except that—
(i) support conditions must be as specified in S6C9; and
(ii) equivalent load shall mean the quarter-point load that produces the same deflection or central moment as
appropriate; and
(iii) the timber species nominated in that standard may be substituted with a different species.
(c) For resistance to impact — The provisions for testing wall systems in ASTM E695-03, except that—
(i) the point of impact must be set 1.5 m above finished floor level or 1.5 m above the part of the specimen
that corresponds to finished floor level; and
(ii) the impact bag must be not less than 225 mm in diameter and not more than 260 mm in diameter and have
a mass of not less than 27.2 kg or more than 27.3 kg; and
(iii) the mass must be achieved by putting loose, dry sand into the bag and must be adjusted before each series
of impact tests; and
(iv) where the impact bag and suspension cannot be vertical at the instant of impact on a curved surface or an
inclined surface, the height of drop is the net height at the point of impact.
(d) For resistance to surface indentation — The test for resistance to surface indentation must be carried out at
three points on the surface of an undamaged sample sheet as follows:
(i) A steel ball of 10 mm diameter with a load of 150 N must be placed gently on the surface of the sheet and
allowed to remain in position for 5 minutes.
(ii) The ball and load must then be removed and the diameter of each impression of the ball on the surface
measured.
(e) For resistance of lift shaft construction to repetitive load — As for (b) except that—
(i) it is sufficient to test one specimen with the pressure applied from the side of the construction on which the
lift will operate; and
(ii) the load must be applied dynamically at a frequency not less than 1 Hz and not more than 3 Hz; and
(iii) equivalent load shall mean the quarter-point load that produces the same central moment as the distributed
load.
S6C11 Criteria for compliance
[2019: Spec C1.8: 6]
The wall system or the specimen of it must fulfil the following criteria:

NCC 2022 Volume One - Building Code of Australia Page 158
S8C1 Scope
[2019: Spec C1.11: 1]
This Specification contains measures to minimise, in the event of fire, the likelihood of external walls covered by S8C2
collapsing outwards as complete panels and the likelihood of panels separating from supporting members.
S8C2 Application
[2019: Spec C1.11: 2]
This Specification applies to buildings having a rise in storeys of not more than 2 with concrete external walls that could
collapse as complete panels (e.g. tilt-up and precast concrete) which—
(a) consist of either single or multiple panels attached by steel connections to lateral supporting members; and
(b) depend on those connections to resist outward movement of the panels relative to the supporting members;
and
(c) have height to thickness ratio not greater than 50.
S8C3 General requirements for external wall panels
[2019: Spec C1.11: 3]
(1) Cast-in inserts and fixings must be anchored into the panel with welded bars or be fixed to the panel reinforcement.
(2) Cast-in inserts for top connections and fixings acting together must be able to resist an ultimate load of two times the
larger of the forces required to develop—
(a) the ultimate bending moment capacity of the panel at its base; or
(b) the overturning moment at the base of the panel arising from an outwards lateral displacement at the top of the
panel equal to one tenth of the panel height.
(3) Top connections of the panel exposed to fire, such as clips and drilled-in inserts, acting together must be able to
resist an ultimate load of six times the larger of the forces required to develop the moment specified in (2)(a) or (b).
(4) Lateral supporting members and their connections must be designed to resist the connection forces specified in (2)
and (3) and in the case of an eaves tie member the force in the member must be determined assuming that it deforms
in a manner compatible with the lateral displacement of the wall panels, and that it acts in tension only.
(5) External wall panels that span vertically must have at least two upper connections per panel to the supporting member,
except that where a number of panels are designed to act as one unit, (e.g. tongue and groove hollow-core panels),
only two upper connections are required for each unit.
(6) External wall panels that span horizontally between columns must have at least two connections at each column.
(7) Connections providing lateral support to a panel must be designed to remain engaged to the supported panel both
before and during a fire.
Notes
The increased forces specified by the multiplier of two or six in (2) and (3) above are to take account of the lower
strength of the connections and members at the higher than ambient temperatures expected in a fire.

Table Notes
(1) Lay = number of strands by the number of individual wires in each strand. For example a lay of 7x19 consists of 7
strands with 19 individual wires in each strand.
(2) Vertical wires require two pulley blocks to each 180° change of direction in the wire.
(3) Near vertical wires may only require one pulley block for each change of direction.
(4) Tension measured with a strain indicator.
(5) The table only includes 7x7 and 7x19 wires due to other wires not having sufficient flexibility to make the necessary
turns.
 Table D3D21c: Wire barrier construction – maximum permissible deflection of each wire in mm when a 2
kg mass is suspended at mid-span for stainless steel wires
Table Notes
(1) Where a change of direction is made in a run of wire the 2 kg mass must be placed at the middle of the longest
span.
(2) If a 3.2 mm wire is used the deflection figures for 3.0 mm wire are applied.
(3) This table may also be used for a set of non-continuous (single) vertical wires forming a barrier using the appropriate
clear distance between posts as the vertical clear distance between the rails. The deflection (offset) is measured
by hooking a standard spring scale to the mid span of each wire and pulling it horizontally until a force of 19.6 N is
applied.
(4) X = Not allowed because the required tension would exceed the safe load of the wire.
(5) This table has been limited to 60 mm and 80 mm spaces for 2.5 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm diameter wires because the
required wire tensions at greater spacings would require the tension to be beyond the wire safe load limit, or the
allowed deflection would be impractical to measure.

J3D11 External winter glazing of a sole-occupancy unit of a Class 2 building or a
Class 4 part of a building
[New for 2022]
(1) In climate zones 2 to 8, the ratio of the conductance (CU) and solar heat gain (CSHGC) of the glazing of each storey,
including any mezzanine, of a sole-occupancy unit of a Class 2 building or a Class 4 part of a building must—
(a) not exceed the allowance obtained from Table J3D11a; and
(b) be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
(2) In the formula at (1)(b)—
(a) = the area of each glazing element; and
(b) = the Total System U-Value of each glazing element; and
(c) = the Total System SHGC for each glazing element, not exceeding 0.7; and
(d) = the winter exposure factor for each glazing element obtained from Table J3D11b, J3D11c, J3D11d,
J3D11e, J3D11f or J3D11g; and
(e) = the bedroom conductance factor obtained from Table J3D11h, J3D11i, J3D11j, J3D11k, J3D11l or
J3D11m; and
(f) = the orientation sector conductance factor obtained from Table J3D11n; and
(g) = the room type factor obtained from Table J3D11h, J3D11i, J3D11j, J3D11k, J3D11l or J3D11m; and
(h) = the bedroom solar heat gain factor obtained from Table J3D11h, J3D11i, J3D11j, J3D11k, J3D11l
or J3D11m; and
(i) = the frame factor obtained from Table J3D11o, J3D11p, J3D11q, J3D11r, J3D11s or J3D11t for each
glazing element; and
(j) = the floor factor obtained from Table J3D11h, J3D11i, J3D11j, J3D11k, J3D11l or J3D11m for each
glazing element.
(3) For the purpose of J3D11—
(a) orientation sectors must be determined in accordance with Figure 13.3.2a of the ABCB Housing Provisions; and
(b) P/H must be determined in accordance with Figure S37C7; and
(c) For P/H between those in Tables J3D11b, J3D11c, J3D11d, J3D11e, J3D11f and J3D11g, either use the next
highest P/H or interpolate.

J3D12 External summer glazing of a sole-occupancy unit of a Class 2 building or a
Class 4 part of a building
[New for 2022]
(1) In climate zones 1 to 7, the aggregate solar heat gain of the glazing in each storey, including any mezzanine, of a
sole-occupancy unit of a Class 2 building or a Class 4 part of a building must—
(a) not exceed the allowance resulting from multiplying the floor area of the storey, including any mezzanine,
measured within the enclosing walls, by the constant CSHGC obtained from Table J3D12a; and
(b) be calculated in accordance with the following formula:
(2) In the formula at (1)(b)—
(a) = the area of each glazing element; and
(b) = the Total System SHGC for each glazing element, not exceeding 0.7; and
(c) = the summer exposure factor for each glazing element obtained from Table J3D12b, J3D12c, J3D12d,
J3D12e, J3D12f, J3D12g or J3D12h.
(d) = the factor obtained from Table J3D12i or Table J3D12j for each glazing element located in a bedroom
or room which is not a conditioned space; and
(e) = the frame factor obtained from Table J3D12i or Table J3D12j for glazing element; and
(f) = the floor factor obtained from Table J3D12i or Table J3D12j for each glazing element.
(3) For the purpose of J3D12—
(a) orientation sectors must be determined in accordance with Figure 13.3.2a of the ABCB Housing Provisions; and
(b) P/H must be determined in accordance with Figure S37C7; and
(c) for P/H between those shown in Tables J3D12b, J3D12c, J3D12d, J3D12e, J3D12f, J3D12g, J3D12h, J3D12i
and J3D12j, either use the next highest P/H or interpolate.
 Table J3D12a: Constant for Solar Heat Gain (CSHGC) — climate zones 1 to 7
Table Notes
(1) The ventilation opening area is the total area of each ventilation opening divided by the floor area of the storey,
including any mezzanine.
(2) No window can have a design ventilation opening greater than 90% because the window frame will always obstruct
some area of the opening.
(3) Interpolation is allowed for values between those shown.

(1) For the purposes of this method, a wall-glazing construction only includes the walls and glazing facing a single aspect.
(2) The Total System U-Value of the wall component of a wall-glazing construction must be calculated as the inverse of
the Total R-Value, including allowance for thermal bridging, in accordance with—
(a) AS/NZS 4859.2; or
(b) Specification 38 for spandrel panels.
(3) The Total System U-Value of a wall-glazing construction must be calculated as the area-weighted average of the
Total System U-Value of each of the components of the wall-glazing construction.
(4) The Total System U-Value must not exceed the applicable value in J4D6(1).
S37C4 U-Value — Method 2 (Multiple Aspects)
[2019: Spec J1.5a: 4]
(1) For the purposes of this method, a wall-glazing construction only includes the walls and glazing facing multiple
aspects.
(2) The Total System U-Value of the wall component of a wall-glazing construction must be calculated as the inverse of
the Total R-Value, including allowance for thermal bridging, in accordance with—
(a) AS/NZS 4859.2; or
(b) Specification 38 for spandrel panels.
(3) The Total System U-Value of a wall-glazing construction must be calculated as the area-weighted average of the
Total System U-Value of each of the components of the wall-glazing construction.

than that achieved by the reference solar admittance, when using the following formula:
(2) In the formula at (1)—
(a) = the representative air-conditioning energy value; and
(b) = the area of the wall-glazing construction facing each aspect; and
(c) = the solar admittance weighting coefficient of each aspect equal to—
(i) where the glazing area on an aspect is less than 20% of the wall-glazing construction area, 0; and
(ii) the values in Table S37C6a and Table S37C6b; and
(d) = the wall-glazing construction solar admittance of each aspect—
(i) equal to the applicable value in J4D6(5) in the reference case; and

Notes
(1) The BCIIP Act is concerned with the regulation of Workplace Relations in the building industry, it also establishes the
Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) (as the workplace relations regulator for the industry) and
the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner (OFSC).
(2) The BCIIP Act legislates additional requirements for those building contractors undertaking Commonwealth funded
building work through the Building Code 2016, regulated by the ABCC, and the Work Health and Safety Accreditation
Scheme (WHS Accreditation Scheme), administered by the OFSC. Of direct relevance to the NCC: Provisions in BCIIP
Act include a requirement that the Federal Safety Commissioner audits building contractors’ compliance with the NCC
in relation to building materials, which is a condition of accreditation under the WHS Accreditation Scheme.
(3) The Australian Government has committed to abolish the ABCC and the Building Code 2016. To achieve this, the
Government has introduced the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022 (the Bill) which
would repeal provisions of the BCIIP Act that provide for the ABCC and the Building Code 2016. The Bill would also
retain provisions of the BCIIP Act that provide for the OFSC and the WHS Accreditation Scheme in a renamed Act,
the Federal Safety Commissioner Act 2022. Builders undertaking Commonwealth-funded building work would still be
required to comply with the NCC.

Introduction to this Part
This NSW Part J1 replaces Part J1.
This Part sets the thermal performance properties of building fabric, the energy efficiency of key energy using equipment
and the features a building must have to facilitate the future installation of distributed energy resources.
Notes
(1) For a Class 2 building or a Class 4 part of a building, where a relevant development consent or an application for
a complying development certificate requires compliance with a BASIX Single Dwelling or Multi Dwelling Certificate
issued under Version 3.0 or earlier, NSW Section J of NCC 2019 Volume One Amendment 1 applies.
(2) For a Class 2 building or a Class 4 part of a building, where a relevant development consent or an application for
a complying development certificate requires compliance with a BASIX Single Dwelling or Multi Dwelling Certificate
issued under Version 4.0 or later, Section J of NCC 2022 Volume One applies.
(3) For a Class 2 building or a Class 4 part of a building, where a relevant development consent or an application for
a complying development certificate requires compliance with a BASIX Alterations and Additions Certificate, NSW
Section J of NCC 2019 Volume One Amendment 1 applies.
(4) For a Class 3 building or Class 5 to 9 building:
(a) From 1 May 2023 to 30 September 2023 NSW Section J of NCC 2019 Volume One Amendment 1 may apply
instead of Section J of NCC 2022 Volume One.
(b) From 1 October 2023 Section J of NCC 2022 Volume One applies.
Notes
In NSW, Class 2 buildings and Class 4 parts of buildings are subject to BASIX (the Building Sustainability Index),
however Class 3 buildings are not.
BASIX is the web-based planning tool designed to assess the potential performance of certain residential buildings
against a range of sustainability indices including thermal comfort and energy. Commitments made under BASIX become
a condition of the relevant development consent or complying development certificate.
BASIX applies in NSW to all new Class 2 buildings and Class 4 parts of buildings; and to alterations and additions to
buildings of those classes where the work is subject to BASIX and also where an applicant elects to comply with BASIX.
The provisions of Section J are therefore designed to complement requirements that arise under BASIX and which are
implemented via the development consent.
Where BASIX is not applied to alterations and additions to these buildings, the provisions will also complement council
development controls that require energy efficiency measures to be incorporated as part of the alterations and additions.
NSW J1O1 Objective

Explanatory Information
In Western Australia state variations apply to wind regions B and D, this includes wind region B2 as referenced in
AS/NZS 1170.2.
The state variation for wind region B or B2 will ensure that designers consider the combination of peak external
pressures and increased internal pressures in design of buildings and use a cyclonic (C) classification instead of noncyclonic (N) classification. The definition of design wind speed is varied in WA Schedule 1 to identify that wind region
B is a C classification in Western Australia. Other changes have also been made to reflect this.
In addition to a variation to clauses B1D3 and B1D4, a variation is made to the application of AS/NZS 1170.2 when
used as either a primary referenced document or a secondary or subsequent referenced document. Refer to WA
Schedule 2 and WA Part B2.

1 Buildings or structures presenting a low degree of hazard to life and other property in the
case of failure.
2 Buildings or structures not included in Importance Level 1, 3 and 4.

WA B2D2 Internal pressure
[New for 2022]
Delete 5.3.1 of AS/NZS 1170.2:2021 and replace with the following:
5.3.1 Internal pressure
5.3.1.1 General
Internal pressure is a function of the external pressures, and the leakage and openings in the external surfaces of the
building or an isolated part of a larger building, and for some large buildings, the internal volume. The open area of a
surface shall be calculated by adding areas of opening to areas of permeability or leakage on that surface of the building
(e.g. vents and gaps in the building envelope).
The height at which the design wind speed is determined for calculation of internal pressures shall be the average roof
height (h), as defined in Figure 2.1. However, for the cases of windward wall leakage or openings on a building greater
than 25 m in height, the design wind speed at the height of the opening shall be used.
Pressure coefficients for internal pressure (Cp,i) shall be determined by either Clause 5.3.1.2 or 5.3.1.3.
NOTE 1 Damage inspections after wind storms, in Regions B2, C and D, have shown that large openings are very
likely to occur accidentally due to failure of elements under direct wind pressure, or in the lower levels of a building
envelope, by debris impact. Large openings can also occur in Regions A (0 to 5), B1 and NZ (1 to 4) under the same
circumstances, although openings produced by debris impact are less likely.
NOTE 2 The equivalent free area of a ventilator (e.g. ridge or under-eave ventilators) can be determined from the
product of discharge coefficient and throat area.
5.3.1.2 Internal pressure coefficients for all cases, except ultimate limit states for parts of buildings below 25 m
in Regions B2, C and D
Clause 5.3.1.1 applies to buildings in all regions for serviceability limit states.
For ultimate limit states, it applies to all buildings in Regions A (0 to 5), B1 and NZ (1 to 4), and parts of buildings higher
than 25 m above ground level in Regions B2, C and D.
Pressure coefficients for internal pressure (Cp,i) shall be determined from Tables 5.1(A) or 5.1(B). Table 5.1(A) shall be
used for the design case where there are no potential openings in any surface with a combined area greater than 0.5 %
of the total area of that surface, and the leakage in the walls lead to internal pressures. Table 5.1(B) shall be used for the
design case where there are openings in any surface greater than 0.5 % of the total area of that surface, or they can be
created accidentally.
5.3.1.3 Internal pressure coefficients for ultimate limit states for parts of buildings below 25 m in Regions B2, C
and D
Pressure coefficients for internal pressure (Cp,i) for parts of a building in Regions B2, C and D below 25 m for ultimate
limit states, shall be determined from Table 5.1(B) only.
The ratio of the sum of opening areas on one surface to total open area of other walls and roof surfaces as defined in
Table 5.1(B) shall not be taken to be less than two unless —
(a) it can be demonstrated that an opening will not be created in the building envelope as a result of impact loading
from the windborne debris defined in Clause 2.5.8; or
(b) a permanently-open roof ventilator, such as a ridge ventilator, has been installed with equivalent total area (see
Clause 5.3.1.1 Note 2) of at least that of the largest areas of any potential accidental openings in the walls, considering
the combined area of wall openings in each wall surface one at a time; or
(c) permanently-open, wall ventilators have been installed on at least two walls, with equivalent total area (see Clause
5.3.1.1 Note 2) of the ventilators on each wall at least that of the largest of any potential accidental openings in the walls,
considering the combined area of wall openings in each wall surface one at a time.
NOTE 1 Low-rise buildings in Regions B2, C and D should be designed for the high internal pressures resulting
from large openings, for ultimate limit states. Even in cases where the opening is small or there is no opening, Table 5.1(A)
is not intended to be used for low-rise buildings in Regions B2, C and D for ultimate limit states.
NOTE 2 To date, the majority of windborne debris in Regions B2, C and D in Australia has not often impacted at
heights on buildings above 25 m. This is not the case in other parts of the world and could change in the future with
increasing numbers of high-rise buildings.

WA B2D3 Openings
[New for 2022]
Delete 5.3.2 of AS/NZS 1170.2:2021 and replace with the following:
5.3.2 Openings
5.3.2.1 General
Openings shall be determined according to either Clause 5.3.2.2 (Regions A (0 to 5), B1 and NZ (1 to 4), and Regions
B2, C, D at heights of 25 m or above) or Clause 5.3.2.3 (Regions B2, C, D below 25 m).
Subject to Clauses 5.3.2.2 and 5.3.2.3, combinations of openings and open area shall be assumed to give internal
pressures, which, together with external pressures, give the most adverse wind actions.
NOTE Potential openings include doors or windows that are left open or may fail, vents that are normally
open and holes in cladding caused by impacts by windborne debris during a major wind event. Openings can be
doors (including balcony doors) or windows that are left open, open under pressure, or open due to the failure of
latches or hinges. When determining internal pressures, consideration should be given to scenarios in which large
openings may develop. Openings may also be generated by debris impacts, particularly in Regions B2, C and D (see
Clause 2.5.8).
5.3.2.2 Openings in buildings in Regions A (0 to 5), B1 and NZ (1 to 4), and parts of buildings at heights of 25
m or above in Regions B2, C and D
The full area of doors, including large access doors (e.g. roller doors), and windows that are normally closed, shall
be regarded as openings, unless they are demonstrated to be capable of resisting the applied wind pressures.
NOTE 1 When assessing internal pressures, designers should consider the principles of robustness, i.e. to avoid
situations where the failure of a single component such as a door or window could lead to consequent and
disproportionate failure of other elements, or even complete failure of the structure.
NOTE 2 The structural assessment of doors that are assumed to remain closed and intact should include elements
such as supports, frames, jambs, roller door guides, wind locks, latches and hinges, and fixings, where the resistance
of doors relies on those. This assessment of roller doors and their supporting structural elements should also account
for any structural resistance to any catenary actions developed by the door under wind load.
5.3.2.3 Openings in buildings for ultimate limit states for parts of buildings below 25 m in Regions B2, C and
D
Doors (including large access doors) and windows that are normally closed, and cladding elements, shall be regarded
as openings with an area equal to the greater of—
(a) the full area of the element, where it has not been demonstrated that it can resist the applied wind pressures; or
(b) the area of opening that results from debris impact, where the debris impact loading criteria are defined in Clause
2.5.8.
